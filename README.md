# Spaceâ€“Time Reduced Order Model for Linear Dynamical Systems

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
This repository contains the source code for the paper **"Efficient Spaceâ€“Time Reduced Order Model for Linear Dynamical Systems in Python Using Less than 120 Lines of Code"**, published in *Mathematics* **2021**, 9, 1690 ([DOI: 10.3390/math9141690](https://doi.org/10.3390/math9141690)).  

The code implements a **Spaceâ€“Time Reduced Order Model (ROM)** to accelerate the simulation of **linear dynamical systems**, leveraging **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)** with **Galerkin** and **Least-Squares Petrovâ€“Galerkin (LSPG)** projections.

## ðŸ›  Features  
- Implements both **Galerkin** and **LSPG** projections for spaceâ€“time ROMs.  
- Handles **diffusion and convection-diffusion** equations in **2D**.  
- Uses **Python** for efficient numerical implementation (less than **120 lines of code** per example).

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
This repository contains the source code for the paper **"Efficient Spaceâ€“Time Reduced Order Model for Linear Dynamical Systems in Python Using Less than 120 Lines of Code"**, published in *Mathematics 2021, 9, 1690* ([DOI: 10.3390/math9141690](https://doi.org/10.3390/math9141690)).  

The code implements a **Spaceâ€“Time Reduced Order Model (ROM)** to accelerate the simulation of **linear dynamical systems**, leveraging **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)** and **Least-Squares Petrovâ€“Galerkin (LSPG) projection**.

## ðŸ›  Features  
- Implements both **Galerkin** and **LSPG** projections for spaceâ€“time ROMs.  
- Handles **diffusion and convection-diffusion** equations in **2D**.  
- Uses **Python** for efficient numerical implementation (less than **120 lines of code** per example).  
- Achieves **significant speed-ups** in solving large-scale linear dynamical systems.  
- Includes **error analysis** and **comparisons** between different ROM formulations.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed with the following dependencies:  
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

### Running an Example  
To run the **2D diffusion equation** example:  
```bash
python examples/diffusion.py
```
For the **2D convection-diffusion** equation:  
```bash
python examples/convection_diffusion.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Results & Performance  
The ROM implementation achieves speed-ups of **O(10-1000x** compared to full-order models (FOMs) while maintaining relative errors below **0.01%** in most cases.
